    "# 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional approach to applying deep learning methods in NLP have involved feeding a model large amounts of labeled training data, and fitting the model's parameters to this data. In practice, natural language data is highly variable and can come in a variety of forms (tweets, blog posts, reviews etc.), and hence, a model trained for a particular language task does not generalize well to new data from another distribution. In addition, many natural language applications do not come with an abundance of labeled examples, and human annotation can get very expensive as the datasets get larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This offers good motivation to explore the notion of [transfer learning](http://ruder.io/transfer-learning/index.html#whatistransferlearning) - a machine-learning technique that has the ability to transfer knowledge to novel scenarios not encountered during training. While transfer learning has been ubiquitous throughout computer vision applications since the advent of huge datasets such as ImageNet, it is only since 2017-18 that significant progress has been made for transfer learning in NLP applications. There have been a string of interesting papers in 2018 that discuss the power of language models in natural language understanding and how they can be used to provide pre-trained representations of a language's syntax, which can be far more useful when training a neural network for previously unseen tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter data is a very interesting use case for transfer learning, mainly because the typical language syntax seen in Tweets is quite different from that which is used to train language models. For these reasons, the **2016 SemEval Stance Detection task** is chosen for studying the effectiveness of our transfer learning approach. The dataset, experiments and the evaluation criteria used are explained in below sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to highlight the development of a model that can help answer the following questions:\n",
    "- How does our approach generalize to Twitter-specific language syntax?\n",
    "- Are we able to achieve reasonable results (comparable to the winning team of SemEval 2016 Task 6) with *limited amounts of training data* and *limited computing resources*?\n",
    "- How much fine-tuning effort is required to achieve reasonable results?"

    "Source: [Attention is all you need, 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the original version from Google Brain used an identical encoder-decoder 6-layer stack, the OpenAI transformer uses similar dual 6-layer encoder-decoder stacks. Each layer has two sub-layers, consisting of a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and a fully connected (position-wise) feed-forward network. A full description of the transformer architecture used for transfer learning is given in the paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is performed in the following stages:\n",
    "1. **Unsupervised pretaining**: The OpenAI transformer is given an unsupervised corpus of tokens from the Google Books corpus (thousands of books) and the pretrained weights are made publicly available for further fine-tuning.\n",
    "2. **Supervised fine-tuning**: We can adapt the parameters to the supervised target task. The inputs are passed through the pre-trained model to obtain the final transformer block's activation $h_{l}^{m}$, which is then fed into an added linear output layer with parameters $W-y$ to predict $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y | x^1, ..., x^m) = softmax(h_{l}^{m}W_y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step (unsupervised pretaining) is *very* expensive, and was done by OpenAI on a large GPU cluster, and need not be repeated in our case - we can directly use the pretrained weights and fine-tune them before training the classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform out-of-domain target tasks such as text classification, the transformer includes language modeling as an additional objective to the fine-tuning, which helps generalized learning [[OpenAI transformer, 2018]](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf).

The single best F-score obtained was when the default values in ```train_stance.py``` were applied for all hyperparameters.  The training accuracy *reduced* with higher dropout, especially in the case of 0.3 dropout on all layers, but this did nothing to improve the F-score.\n",

    "# 8. Conclusions\n",
    "This notebook showed a training and classification pipeline for a PyTorch-port of the OpenAI transformer for evaluating stance of Tweets towards a particular topic. With some basic data cleaning operations and adding some custom code for task-specific goals, the transfer learning approach using the OpenAI transformer seems to provide good classification accuracy F-scores (compared with the winning results from the SemEval 2016 winning team *MITRE*). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefit of using the OpenAI transformer is that it appears to generalize well to a completely different distribution (i.e., Tweets), with very minimal modifications to the original framework and minimal hyperparameter fine-tuning. In addition to the relative ease of adapting the transformer code, the model's is also quite inexpensive. The fine-tuning of the language model and the classification layer happens simultaneously, and we achieve a good F-score (of 0.69) comparable to that of the winning team *MITRE* (0.67), in **just 2-3 epochs of training!** This shows that transformers are a promising tool to perform generalizable transfer learning for a wide range of classification tasks, even when the input distribution is very different from the pretrained language model's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the transformer is that it is prone to overfitting when we have a very small input dataset (of ~500 Tweets). This is noticeable when we try to perform classification on each topic *individually*, where we only have around 500 Tweets per topic. In that case, the F-score drops as does the validation accuracy (whereas training accuracy remains very high) indicating significant overfitting. This makes sense considering that the transformer has 786 dimensions on the task-heads, so we would logically have to train it on a dataset several times this size. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can likely further improve the classification accuracy across all topics by feeding in a larger dataset, of several thousand Tweets to the transformer model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Tweets are sufficiently different from typical language data used to generate pre-trained language models, and  hence are an interesting usecase for analyzing the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques. It will be interesting to see how transfer learning techniques for such NLP tasks evolve with time."
